<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Basic export =

R can easily write an object to a text file via the function, `write.table`:

{{{
   write.table(mydata, "C:/mydata.txt", sep="\t")
}}}

Type `?write.table` for examples and options

= Exporting geolocation results from KF packages found on this site =

Assume we have run our tracks successfully, and everything is in an active R session, we can output the tracks for other programs.

   * Download the export script for R, [http://geolocation.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/updates/fit2csv.R fit2csv] (Right-click to "save link/ file as")
 
   * Make sure you note where you save the downloaded file. Drag-and-drop the file into the main R window, or use the function, `source`
   
   {{{
# Note: delete the hash sign (#) to uncomment a line

# Preparation; define working directory:
setwd("C:/Test")

# Main code:

source("fit2csv.R")
fit2csv(fit1)
fit2csv(fit2)
   }}}   

   * A set of output files (e.g `fit1a.csv`, `fit1b.csv`, `fit1c.csv`) will be generated for each tag
   The output files are:
   * `-a.csv` - track points
   * `-b.csv` - model parameters
   * `-c.csv` - initialization values to model
