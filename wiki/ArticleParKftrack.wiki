|| *Parameter* || *Usage* || *Initial value * || * Unit * ||
|| u || "advection" component of movement; northward component of directed movement || 0 || nm/day ||
|| v || "advection" component of movement; eastward component of directed movement || 0 || nm/day ||
|| D || "diffusion" component of movement. A measure of the variability in movement  || 100 || nm^2/day || 
|| bx || systematic error (or bias) in the estimation of position (longitude) || 0 || degree ||
|| by || systematic error (or bias) in the estimation of position (latitude) || 0 || degree ||
|| sx || random error in the estimation of position (longitude) || 0.5 || degree ||
|| sy || random error in the estimation of position (latitude) || 1.5 || degree ||
|| a0 || upper bound for latitude variance (keep the tagged animal in this planet). Used in "solstice" variance structure, related to how the latitude estimation error varies around the equinox. || 0.0001 || degree ||
|| b0 || the number of days prior to the equinox where the latitude error is maximal. Used in "solstice" variance structure, related to how the latitude estimation error varies around the equinox. || 0 || day ||
