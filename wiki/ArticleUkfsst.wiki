= Overview = 

UKFSST is an add-on package for the statistical environment R to efficiently estimate movement parameters and predict the most probable track from raw light-based geolocations and sea surface temperatures (SST). This package offers an approach to use both types of information in one coherent state-space model and carries out the estimation via the unscented Kalman filter (UKF).

= How to use =

UKFSST comes with a function explaining how to fit a track. It covers all steps from how to read in the raw track, automatically obtain SST-field, fit the track, and plot and investigate the final track. This help is displayed by typing:
  {{{
  road.map()
  }}}
Also the package comes with a complete example. To see it type:
  {{{
  example(blue.shark)
  }}}

# Obtain a corresponding SST-field
# Reconstruct the track
# Investigate the fitted track by plots and summaries
