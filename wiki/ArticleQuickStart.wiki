#summary Running a geolocation analysis in Windows (other platforms to follow)

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Installation of R and geolocation packages =

*[http://www.r-project.org/ R]* is being very rapidly developed and geolocation packages may sometimes lag in catching up with fundamental changes made in *[http://www.r-project.org/ R]* that renders some older routines non-functional. To take a conservative approach, we recommend the following installation:

  * R-2.8.1
	
		http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/2.8.1/
  
  * Geolocation packages
  
		http://tagbase.googlecode.com/files/library.zip
  
Move the extracted package folders into the R library folder. To find out where your R library folder is located, type in R:

	`library()`

And look for something like this:

	`Packages in library 'C:/R/R-2.8.1/library':`

  * Inform yourself with an overview of the geolocation methods:

  * Refer to *[http://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0BwcYza_M2AiqZmVjNDBhYzgtMzBlZi00OTQ1LWE3NDAtNzRiYjhmYmJiOTEw&hl=en PFRP Trackit Workshop materials]* for more detailed tutorials
  

= Conducting an example run of different geolocation packages =

  * Start up R, copy-and-paste lines or block of code to run the commands

  * Kftrack
  
  {{{
# Note: delete the hash sign (#) at the beginning to uncomment a line

library(kftrack)
data(big.241) # load packaged example data
track <- big.241
#track<-read.table(’datafile.dat’, header=TRUE) # change file name and path for your own file
fit1 <-kftrack(track)
fit1 # inspect model parameters
plot(fit1, map=FALSE, ci=TRUE)
save(fit1, file="kf-example.Rdata")
  }}}
  
  * Ukfsst or Kfsst
  
  {{{
# Note: delete the hash sign (#) at the beginning to uncomment a line

library(ukfsst)
#library(kfsst)
data(blue.shark) # load packaged example data
#track<-read.table(’datafile.dat’, header=TRUE) # change file name and path for your own file
sst.path<-get.sst.from.server(track)
#sst.file<-write.sst.field(sst.path) # only used in kfsst
fit2<-kfsst(track)
fit2 # inspect model parameters
plot(fit2, map=FALSE, ci=TRUE)
save(fit2, file="kf-example.Rdata")
  }}}
    
= Exporting results from R =

Assume we have run our tracks successfully, and everything is in an active R session, we can output the tracks for other programs.

   * Download the export script for R, [http://geolocation.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/updates/fit2csv.R
 `fit2csv`]
 
   * Make sure you note where you save the downloaded file. Drag-and-drop the file into the main R window, or use the function, `source`
   
   {{{
# Note: delete the hash sign (#) to uncomment a line

# Preparation; define working directory:
setwd("C:/Test")

# Main code:

source("fit2csv.R")
fit2csv(fit1)
fit2csv(fit2)
   }}}   

   * A set of output files (e.g `fit1a.csv`, `fit1b.csv`, `fit1c.csv`) will be generated for each tag
   The output files are:
   * `-a.csv` - track points
   * `-b.csv` - model parameters
   * `-c.csv` - initialization values to model
