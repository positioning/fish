#summary Summary of Trackit parameters

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Parameters of Trackit =

|| *Parameter* || *Usage* || *Initial value * || * Unit * ||
|| u || "advection" component of movement; northward component of directed movement || 0 || nm/day ||
|| v || "advection" component of movement; eastward component of directed movement || 0 || nm/day ||
|| D || "diffusion" component of movement. A measure of the variability in movement  || 100 || nm^2/day || 
|| ss1 || light covariance parameter 1 - two light measurements taken near the same solar event are more similar (correlated) than two taken at separate solar events || 1 || N/A ||
|| ss2 || light covariance parameter 2 - correlation between two light measurements near the same solar event decreases as the time between them increases || 5 || N/A ||
|| ss3 || independent measurement errors in light || 1 || N/A ||
|| rho || light covariance parameter used in combination with ss1 & ss2, see Nielsen & Sibert 2007 for equations|| 0.01 || N/A ||
|| bsst || systematic error (or bias) in the estimation of sea-surface temperature, SST || 1 || degree Celsius ||
|| sssst || random error in the estimation of sea-surface temperature, SST || 0.1 || degree Celsius ||
|| rad || smoothing radius of SST data; radius centered from a given point within which satellite SST data are used || 200 || nm ||
|| phi || a collection of points (n = a2lpoints, default at 15) used to model a light curve with a cubic spine || See ?trackit || N/A ||

= Other options =

|| *Option* || *Usage* || *Initial value * || * Unit * ||
||a2lpoints || No. of points used to model light curve, see phi || 15 || N/A ||
||blue.light.only || Not implemented right now || FALSE || N/A ||
|| dep1 || Not implemented right now || 0 || N/A ||
|| dep2 || Not implemented right now || 0 || N/A ||
