= Importing data into R =

Since there are many tutorial written to import and export data, we will refer to pages that do a good job in describing that process (below).

However we have some tips for users:

  * 1. Know your working directory
  
  Your working directory is the first place R looks for reading and writing files, so your life will be a lot easier if you know where this directory is. Working directory can be looked up with R via the command:
{{{
   getwd()
}}}
	
  To reassign your working directory, put your directory path in quotes (single or double):  
{{{
    setwd("C:/temp")
}}}
   
   or in Linux and Mac
{{{
   setwd("~/temp")
}}}
   
  Once you know your work directory, you can supply a filename of the files residing in the working directory without specifying the exact path, e.g.
{{{
   read.csv("mydata.csv")
}}}
  
  instead of
{{{
   read.csv("C:/temp/mydata.csv")
}}}
   
  * 2. Use a single forward slash for directory path (think Linux/ Mac) or use double backslash in Windows:
{{{ 
   setwd("C:\\temp")
}}}

  * 3. Make sure you use the correctly capitalized file names. This process is easily accomplished with "auto-complete as you type" feature via the "Tab" button across different platforms.  Or in Windows, drag-and-drop the file into the R main session window, and the full path of that file will be exposed.
