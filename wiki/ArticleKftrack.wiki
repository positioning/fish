#summary Kftrack package

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Overview = 

Kftrack is an add-on package for the statistical environment *R* to estimate movement parameters and predict "the most probable track" from any given position pairs (longitude, latitude). Its basic use is to fit and plot the model described in Sibert et al. 2003.

The model is one of the most simple yet versatile tools for geolocation. It is recommended to use this model on any continuous tracking data, including GPS/ Argos satellite tags. Using Kftrack allows a complete description of errors and estimation of movement parameters. Kftrack runs very fast and can handle tough/ messy data situation when other more advanced models may not provide a good fit.

    # Start and end positions are assumed to known and "without any errors"
    # Set `fix.last=FALSE` if you are unsure about your end position
	# You can also set `fix.first=FALSE` for the start position
  # Plot the results
    # Use `ci=TRUE` to show the confidence regions
