The KFSST Repository

**This folder contains three folders: 

kfsst: contains a 'source' folder for the 
ADMB parts of the program, and a binary 
folder 'bin' with the windows binary already 
build. The folder also contains a few 
different compile scripts. 

Rcode: Contains the R-code for the package 
all within one file in the folder. 

Rpack: Contains a folder 'manEdited' of 
documentation files, and a folder 'webcode' 
with stuff for setting up the web-page. 
Finally the important script 'doitall.R'.

**How to compile the package: 

To build the package from source simply 
change into the 'Rpack' folder and type: 

  echo "source('doitall.R')" | R --vanilla

This will compile the ADMB program and build 
the package and set up the 'web' folder in 
the 'Rpack' folder.

Notice: If changes are made in the folder 
'kfsst/kfsst/source' then it is necessary to 
generate the windows binary 
'kfsst/kfsst/bin/kfsst.exe' on a windows 
machine, reboot into linux and run the 
'doitall.R' script again. 

To upload the folder 'web' use the script:  

  ./upload

(Assuming you are already in the 'Rpack' 
folder) 

That's all.
