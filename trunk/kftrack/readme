Directory '4/' contains the following files and 
folders: 

cleanup                 A small script for cleaning 
                        up before recompiling. 
                        Basically it returns the 
                        directory to source files 
                        only.     

data/                   In this directory are the 
                        included data.frames stored. 
                        They can be stored in 
                        several formats, but a 
                        simple and platform 
                        independent one is to use 
                        the 'dump' command from 
                        within R.

homepage.html           The source for the webpage.

kftrack.R               The R-source code. 

makeadmb                The makefile for the admb 
                        part of the package.

makepack*               Script for compiling the 
                        entire package, admb, 
                        webpage, documentation ...
                           
man/                    Documentation source 
                        files for all r-functions. 
                        If a new R-function is 
                        added, a template for its 
                        help file can be created 
                        via the 'prompt' function.   

src/                    Source files for the admb 
                        part of the package. 

jpg4web/		A few graphics files to 
			spice up the webpage. 

So, in order to change anything in the package, all 
that needs to be done is to: 1) Make a copy of the 
directory. 2) Make the changes.  3) Run the command: 

./makepack   

This will tell if the documentation is lagging or 
if some examples did not run. Presently the GMT 
part of the package fails on xeon2, because GMT is 
not installed on that machine. (Ignore it or 
install GMT)

If you want to change the version number of the 
package this is done in the beginning of the 
'makepack' script.

Once the 'makepack' has been completed successfully 
the result is that a few extra directories are 
generated. The most important being the 'web/' 
directory. This directory contains the setup for 
putting the package on the web, including the 
compiled package, and the documentation. Just open  
'index.html' in a browser, it has link to all you 
need. 

(the compiled R-package is 'web/kftrack_0.4.tar.gz' 
and the reference manual is 
'web/kftrack/doc/KFtrack-ref-manual.pdf')

To reset the entire directory simply run the 
command:     

./cleanup 

That's all that need to be done to compile the 
Linux version.



***The windows version: 
What needs to be done is:

1) INSTALL the the package under Linux. 

  su
  R CMD INSTALL kftrack_0.4.tar.gz

2) zip the contents of <<R_HOME>>/library/kftrack

  cd /usr/lib/R/library/
  zip -r9l ~/Rkftrack/4/kftrack.zip kftrack/
  cd -

3) Save the 'kftrack.zip' on the network and 
reboot under windows. Unzip, and delete the linux 
binary files from the 'kftrack/admb/' folder. 

4) Compile under windows the file 'kftrack.tpl' 
from 'kftrack/admb/src/' directory and place the 
binary file 'kftrack.exe' in 'kftrack/admb/'. 
This require a makefile that matches your setup. 

5) zip the updated directory. As you know this 
has coursed problems with line endings, but if 
you use the zip from cygwin and the command: 

  zip -r9 kftrack.zip kftrack 

it all seems to work. 

ALL DONE.
